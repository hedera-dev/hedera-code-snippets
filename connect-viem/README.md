# Connect to Hedera Testnet via Viem

This code snippets demonstrates how to connect to Hedera Testnet
using Viem.

## Code

Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env`,
then edit it to add the URL for a JSON-RPC endpoint for Hedera Testnet.

To obtain this URL, see the [JSON-RPC connections documentation](https://docs.hedera.com/hedera/tutorials/more-tutorials/json-rpc-connections/).

In the `connect.js` file in this directory,
an instance of `viem.Chain` is created as `hederaTestnetChain`.
This is essentially configuration for the RPC connection.
The cirtical part within this is `rpcUrls.default.http`,
where the JSON_RPC endpoint value is set.

Subsequently a couple of RPCs are invoked to obtain the block number,
and the HBAR balance of a specified account.
These are simply to verify that the connection works properly.
